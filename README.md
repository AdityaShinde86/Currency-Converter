# Welcome to my portfolio repository!

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, REST API
Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website serves as an interactive and responsive Currency Converter. Users can convert values between different currencies using exchange rates fetched from APIs in real-time.
Currency selection dropdowns make entering the base and target currencies easy, while the flag icons of currencies are converted in an animated manner. Users can enter the amount they want to convert, and see the computed value and exchange rate flags change in real-time. The converter also validates user input, improving the overall experience.
This project focuses on fetching data using include, which demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript. It also features basic error handling with a set of possible errors, such as invalid data and API unavailability.
The design is fully responsive, adapting to any device whether it is a mobile, tablet, or desktop. This project helped strengthen my skills in JavaScript logic and responsive front-end design.
